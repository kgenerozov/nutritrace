# Public REST API

General-purpose REST routes under `/api/v1`, for your own scripts and
automations that want plain JSON over HTTP, rather than the [Model
Context Protocol](https://traceapps.github.io/docs/nutritrace/mcp/)
NutriTrace also speaks. Off by default. Pull-based, if you want to be
notified the instant something happens instead of polling, see
[outgoing webhooks](webhooks.md).

This is distinct from the [Federation API](federation.md): federation
(`/api/v1/foods`, `/api/v1/workouts`, `/api/v1/activity`,
`/api/v1/body-measurements`) is a stable wire contract for sister
TraceApps and is always on. The routes on this page
(`/api/v1/diary`, `/api/v1/goals`, `/api/v1/meals`, `/api/v1/steps`,
`/api/v1/body-composition`, `/api/v1/profile`) are for a user's own personal automation and are
gated behind the flags below.

## Enabling it

Set these in your server environment (see `DEPLOY.md`):

```
PUBLIC_API_ENABLED=1        # turns on the read routes below
PUBLIC_API_WRITE_ENABLED=1  # optional, turns on the write routes too
```

## Authentication

Same personal access tokens as MCP and federation: create one in
Settings, API Tokens (admin, multi-user mode only, a token needs a real
account to own it). Send it as a bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer nt_pat_...
```

A token's `mcp:read`/`mcp:write` scopes govern both MCP tools and these
routes the same way: a token with `mcp:read` can read via either
interface, `mcp:write` unlocks the write routes on either interface
too. There is no separate REST-only scope to create.

## Rate limiting

Each token is limited to 60 requests per minute by default
(`API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` to change it). Responses carry
`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset`; a
`429` response also carries `Retry-After`.

## Errors

A bad request (a malformed date, a date that doesn't exist such as
`2026-02-31`, a reversed date range, a meal id with no match) returns `400`
with `{"error": "..."}`. A missing or invalid token returns `401`; a
token lacking the required scope returns `403`.

## Endpoints

### Read (require `mcp:read`)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/diary/:date` | One day's logged food items. `date` defaults to today. |
| GET | `/api/v1/diary/:date/totals` | Summed nutrition (calories, macros, any micronutrients present) plus total water for that day. |
| GET | `/api/v1/goals` | Current goals (legacy-compatible response). Add `?date=YYYY-MM-DD` for one effective day, or `?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD` for an inclusive historical range. |
| GET | `/api/v1/meals/search?query=&limit=&include_recipes=` | Search the saved meals catalog by name, or list all when `query` is omitted. Recipes excluded by default. |
| GET | `/api/v1/meals/recent?limit=&include_recipes=&start=&end=` | Most-recently-used saved meals. Optional inclusive `YYYY-MM-DD` `start`/`end` filter by the date each meal was last used; either can be left out. |
| GET | `/api/v1/meals/:id` | One saved meal's full contents, including every item. |
| GET | `/api/v1/steps?start=&end=&source=` | Persisted daily step observations from wellness data, one row per source. Inclusive `YYYY-MM-DD` bounds; a supplied bound leaves the other side open, both omitted means the last 90 days. `source` filters to one provider. Sources are never merged and missing days are not zeros. |
| GET | `/api/v1/body-composition?start=&end=&source=` | Persisted body-composition observations from `wellness_data`. Inclusive `YYYY-MM-DD` bounds; a supplied bound leaves the other side open, both omitted means the last 90 days. `source` is an optional exact filter. Metrics are grouped by `date` + `source`; observations from different sources remain separate, and missing observations are omitted rather than synthesized. |
| GET | `/api/v1/profile` | The user's gender and date of birth as set on the Profile page or during onboarding. Either field is `null` when unset. |

### Goal history and effective dates

`GET /api/v1/goals` with no query parameters preserves the existing response.

For historical reporting, ask NutriTrace to resolve the effective target instead
of applying today's settings to an old diary day:

```
GET /api/v1/goals?date=2026-09-23
GET /api/v1/goals?start=2026-09-21&end=2026-09-27
```

Historical dates are **user-local calendar dates**. A snapshot is effective from
its `effective_from` date (inclusive) until the next snapshot. Multiple edits on
one calendar day collapse to the final complete configuration for that day. Goal
templates are recorded as one bulk update, so goals and water cannot appear as
a partial template state.

Historical responses include the stored configuration plus `resolved_goals`,
`calorie_target_kcal`, `calorie_basis`, and
`activity_adjustment_kcal`. Resolution follows NutriTrace's own weekday-goal,
percentage-macro, Dynamic, Adaptive, and activity-adjustment rules. Callers
should use these resolved values rather than reimplementing the formulas.

History begins when this feature is installed (or the first snapshot is
recorded). NutriTrace does **not** invent older history from today's settings.
A date before the first recorded snapshot returns `known: false` with
`reason: "before_first_recorded_snapshot"` and
`history_available_from`. Range responses expose whether every day was known
through `history_complete`.

### Write (require `mcp:write` and `PUBLIC_API_WRITE_ENABLED=1`)

| Method | Path | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/diary/:date/food` | `{food_id, meal?, quantity?, portion?, unit?, notes?}` | Appends a food from the user's catalog to a diary day. `food_id` comes from the foods federation endpoint or the app's own search. |
| POST | `/api/v1/diary/:date/water` | `{amount_ml, time?}` | Appends a water log entry. |
| POST | `/api/v1/diary/:date/meal` | `{meal_id, meal?}` | Expands a saved meal's items into a diary day. |
| PUT | `/api/v1/diary/:date/body-stat` | `{stats: {weight?, body_fat?, waist?, ...}}` | Merges the given values into that day's body stats. |

Not yet exposed here: editing or deleting a diary entry, or creating a
new catalog food. Those stay MCP-only for now (`edit_diary_entry`,
`delete_diary_entry`, `create_food` in the MCP setup guide), since each
requires `MCP_DESTROY_ENABLED` plus the `mcp:destroy` scope plus
`confirm: true` on the MCP side, and this surface has not needed that
capability yet.

Also not duplicated here: food search and recent-foods. The existing
federation route `GET /api/v1/foods?q=` (scope `read:foods`) already
covers searching the foods catalog; mint a token with `read:foods` and
use that endpoint instead of a second, overlapping route.
