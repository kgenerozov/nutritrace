# TraceApps Federation API

A Bearer-authenticated REST API that NutriTrace exposes for sister apps
in the TraceApps ecosystem (LiftTrace public, CookTrace in private
development, plus any self-hosted custom integrations) to consume.

This is an **internal cross-app contract**, not a public API for
third-party developers. The wire format is stable across NT releases
within a major version; consumers code against this document, not
against NT's internal database schema.

---

## Versioning

Endpoints live at `/api/v1/`. The `v1` namespace is the contract.
Breaking schema changes require shipping `v2` in parallel; v1 is not
broken without long lead time.

Within v1, additive changes (new fields on existing objects, new
endpoints) are non-breaking and may ship at any time. Consumers must
ignore unknown fields.

---

## Authentication

Bearer token. Tokens are generated per-user in the NutriTrace UI
(Settings → Admin → API Tokens), shown to the user once at creation,
and stored as a SHA-256 hash on the server.

```
Authorization: Bearer nt_pat_<32-byte-base64>
```

A token belongs to exactly one user. Calls made with the token act as
that user, scoped to that user's foods, recipes, and diary entries.
There is no concept of a "service account" or app-level token.

Token format prefix: `nt_pat_` so leaked tokens are recognizable in
logs and credential scanners.

### Scopes

Each token carries a list of scopes. Calls outside a token's scopes
return `403 Forbidden`. Available scopes:

| Scope             | Grants                                                                           |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `read:foods`      | List + read foods owned by the user. Used by CookTrace (in private development). |
| `read:wellness`   | Read the token owner's stored wellness history (Health Connect, wearable, federation body metrics, LiftTrace calorie rollups, and any other `wellness_data` source) via `GET /api/v1/wellness`. Does **not** grant MCP nutrition tools. |
| `write:workouts`  | Push completed workouts to the user's wellness data via `POST /api/v1/workouts`. Used by LiftTrace so its calorie estimates feed NutriTrace's dynamic-TDEE calculations. |
| `write:body-measurements` | Push scale readings (weight, body composition) via `POST /api/v1/body-measurements`. Aimed at Home Assistant, Node-RED, Gadgetbridge and other headless integrations that pull data from BLE smart scales the phone can't see. |
| `mcp:read`        | MCP nutrition/goals/diary/food catalog tools under `/api/mcp`. Does **not** grant `GET /api/v1/wellness`. |

Future scopes (`read:meals`, `read:diary`, etc.) will be added alongside
the endpoints they unlock; gating tokens on scopes the server can't
actually serve is confusing UI. `mcp:read` is not a generic "read everything"
scope.

### Rate limiting

60 requests / minute per token by default. Configurable via
`API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` env var. Limit headers returned on every
response:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit:     60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 47
X-RateLimit-Reset:     1714750000
```

Over-limit responses return `429 Too Many Requests` with a
`Retry-After` header (seconds).

---

## Wire format conventions

- All responses are JSON.
- Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC strings.
- Numeric nutrition fields are in the units listed in the field name
  (e.g. `calories` is kcal, `proteins` is grams). Consumers map to
  their own unit preferences on the way in.
- `null` is used for "not set." Empty string is reserved for "set to
  empty" (rarely used).
- Unknown fields must be ignored by consumers (forward-compat).
- Identifiers are integers, scoped to the issuing instance. A food
  with `id: 42` on instance A has nothing to do with `id: 42` on
  instance B.

---

## Phase 1 endpoints

### `GET /api/v1/me`

Identity check. Useful for clients to verify the token is valid and
discover which user it belongs to.

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "alice",
    "full_name": "Alice Example",
    "role": "admin"
  },
  "instance": {
    "url":     "https://nutritrace.example.com",
    "version": "1.0.0-rc.14"
  },
  "scopes": ["read:foods"]
}
```

Always available regardless of token scopes (it's identity, not data).

### `GET /api/v1/foods`

List foods owned by the authenticated user. Supports basic filtering.

Query parameters:

| Param      | Type    | Default | Description                          |
|------------|---------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `q`        | string  | —       | Substring match on `name` or `brand` |
| `limit`    | int     | 100     | Max results, capped at 500           |
| `offset`   | int     | 0       | Pagination offset                    |
| `category` | string  | —       | Filter by exact category match       |

Response:

```json
{
  "items": [ Food, Food, ... ],
  "total": 1240,
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 0
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/foods/{id}`

Fetch a single food by its NutriTrace id. Returns `404` if the food
doesn't exist or is not readable by the token's user.

### `POST /api/v1/body-measurements`

**Requires scope:** `write:body-measurements`.

Record a scale reading (weight + body composition) for the
authenticated user. Values land in `diary.body_stats` for the day
derived from `measured_at` (server local timezone), the same row
that the manual body-stats UI, the Withings sync, and the diary
view all read from.

**Semantics.** Overwrites only the fields the payload actually sends.
Anything already in `body_stats` under other keys stays untouched, so
a HA-pushed weight doesn't stomp a manual `notes` entry. Send the
same measurement twice → last write wins (fine for idempotency: same
values, same result).

**Request body** — snake_case or camelCase accepted; snake_case wins
on collision. Only `measured_at` is required; any subset of the
measurement fields can be provided.

```json
{
  "measured_at":    "2026-07-25T16:10:51Z",
  "source":         "home-assistant",

  "weight":         76.9,
  "body_fat":       21.2,
  "muscle_mass":    56.14,
  "bone_mass":      3.01,
  "body_water":     54,
  "lean_body_mass": 60,

  "bmi":            24.3,
  "visceral_fat":   11,
  "protein":        20.7,
  "bmr":            1590,
  "metabolic_age":  28,
  "impedance":      465,
  "body_score":     73
}
```

**Field → storage mapping.** The first six map to NT's native
`body_stats` keys used by the diary UI:

| Wire field       | Unit | Storage key            |
|------------------|------|------------------------|
| `weight`         | kg   | `weight_kg`            |
| `body_fat`       | %    | `body_fat_pct`         |
| `muscle_mass`    | kg   | `muscle_mass_kg`       |
| `bone_mass`      | kg   | `bone_mass_kg`         |
| `body_water`     | %    | `body_water_pct`       |
| `lean_body_mass` | kg   | `lean_mass_kg`         |

The remaining fields (`bmi`, `visceral_fat`, `protein`, `bmr`,
`metabolic_age`, `impedance`, `body_score`) are stored under their
wire names in the same JSON blob. NT doesn't render them today but
they round-trip cleanly if the UI ever exposes them, and they're
included in server backups.

**Where the values show up.** Every numeric metric writes to two
places, matching the Withings sync pattern:

- **`diary.body_stats`** — populates the Body Stats card on the diary
  page for that date.
- **`wellness_data`** with `source='federation'` — populates the
  Wellness → Body tab (Weight, Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Bone Mass,
  Body Water, Lean Mass, etc.) so all six standard metrics render
  alongside anything synced from Withings / Fitbit / Health Connect.

**Validation.** Each numeric field is range-checked against a
sanity envelope (e.g. `weight` 10-500 kg, `body_fat` 1-80 %). Any
out-of-range value rejects the whole request with
`400 out_of_range` and a `field` pointer, so a mis-scaled
integration (grams instead of kg) fails loudly instead of
corrupting the diary.

**Response** — `201 Created`:

```json
{
  "ok":     true,
  "date":   "2026-07-25",
  "stored": ["weight_kg", "body_fat_pct", "muscle_mass_kg", "bone_mass_kg"]
}
```

`stored` lists the storage keys that were actually written, so the
integration can log/confirm what landed.

**Example** — one-liner from a Home Assistant automation:

```bash
curl -X POST https://nutritrace.example.com/api/v1/body-measurements \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer nt_pat_...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "measured_at": "2026-07-25T07:12:00Z",
    "source":      "xiaomi-bodymiscale",
    "weight":      76.9,
    "body_fat":    21.2
  }'
```

**Reading data back.** `GET /api/v1/body-measurements` is not yet
implemented — that route remains write-only. Stored body/wellness
metrics (including `source='federation'` rows written by this POST)
are readable through `GET /api/v1/wellness` with `read:wellness`.

### `GET /api/v1/wellness`

**Requires scope:** `read:wellness`. A token that only has `mcp:read`
receives `403 auth_scope`.

Read stored `wellness_data` rows owned by the token user. The owner is
always `req.apiUser.id`. There is no `user_id` query parameter; a
caller cannot read another user's rows.

This endpoint inherits the federation Bearer rate limit
(`API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN`, default 60/min, `429` + `Retry-After`).

**Query parameters:**

| Param         | Type    | Required | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `from`        | date    | yes      | Inclusive start, source health-day `YYYY-MM-DD`. Not converted to a UTC datetime boundary. |
| `to`          | date    | yes      | Inclusive end, same date-only semantics. |
| `source`      | string  | no       | Exact `source` match. Repeat the parameter for an OR list (`source=a&source=b`). No server-side whitelist; unknown sources are valid filters. |
| `metric_type` | string  | no       | Exact `metric_type` match. Repeat for an OR list. No whitelist of known metric names. |

Malformed `from`/`to` (wrong shape or calendar-invalid) → `400` (`bad_from` / `bad_to`).
`from > to` → `400` (`bad_range`). Inclusive range longer than 366 days → `400` (`range_too_large`).
Missing or invalid Bearer → `401`. Missing scope → `403`.

**Missing vs zero.** If no row exists for a `(date, source, metric_type)`,
that combination is omitted. The API never synthesizes `value: 0` for an
absent metric. If the database actually stores numeric `0`, the wire
returns `0`.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "from": "2026-09-01",
  "to": "2026-09-06",
  "rows": [
    {
      "date": "2026-09-06",
      "source": "health_connect",
      "metric_type": "steps",
      "value": 123,
      "metadata": {},
      "synced_at": "2026-09-06T14:33:59Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

`rows` is the top-level array name. Ordering is deterministic:
`date ASC, source ASC, metric_type ASC`.

Wire objects do not include `user_id`, username, or token fields.
Consumers must ignore unknown additive fields.

`metadata` is stored as JSON text. The wire value is a JSON object, or
`null` when the stored text is not a JSON object (malformed JSON,
arrays, primitives). Empty / SQL NULL metadata becomes `{}`. Unknown
object keys are preserved.

`synced_at` is SQLite `datetime('now')` UTC (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`)
converted to ISO-8601 UTC (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`) on the wire. Stored
timestamps are not rewritten.

GET is read-only: it does not insert, update, or delete `wellness_data`
rows.

Field reference:

| Field         | Type             | Notes                                               |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | integer          | Stable within instance. Cross-instance refs MUST include the instance URL. |
| `name`        | string           | Required.                                           |
| `brand`       | string \| null   |                                                     |

### Nutrition keys (Phase 1)

The following keys are guaranteed present in `nutrition` if the food
has the data. Unknown keys may appear in future versions; consumers
must ignore them.

| Key                | Unit          |
|--------------------|---------------|
| `calories`         | kcal          |
| `fat`              | g             |
| `saturated-fat`    | g             |
| `trans-fat`        | g             |
| `monounsaturated-fat` | g          |
| `polyunsaturated-fat` | g          |
| `cholesterol`      | mg            |
| `sodium`           | mg            |
| `potassium`        | mg            |
| `carbohydrates`    | g             |
| `fiber`            | g             |
| `sugars`           | g             |
| `added-sugars`     | g             |
| `proteins`         | g             |
| `calcium`          | mg            |
| `iron`             | mg            |
| `magnesium`        | mg            |
| `phosphorus`       | mg            |
| `zinc`             | mg            |
| `caffeine`         | mg            |
| `alcohol`          | g             |
| `vitamin-a`        | µg            |
| `vitamin-c`        | mg            |
| `vitamin-d`        | µg            |
| `vitamin-e`        | mg            |
| `vitamin-k`        | µg            |
| `b1` ... `b12`     | mg / µg       |

## Errors

Standard HTTP status codes plus a JSON body:

```json
{ "error": "Token required",        "code": "auth_missing" }
{ "error": "Invalid token",         "code": "auth_invalid" }
{ "error": "Token lacks read:foods","code": "auth_scope" }
{ "error": "Not found",             "code": "not_found" }
{ "error": "Rate limited",          "code": "rate_limited" }
```

Consumers should switch on `code` (stable) rather than parsing
`error` (human-readable, may change).

---

## Phasing

**Phase 1 (current):** read-only. `read:foods` scope, foods endpoints,
token management UI, rate limiting, this document.

**Phase 2 (later):** more read scopes — `read:meals` (recipes),
`read:diary`. Strictly additive; existing tokens keep working.

**Phase 3 (later, with care):** targeted write endpoints for cross-app
flows (e.g. `write:diary` for LiftTrace pushing workouts into the NT
diary as activity entries). Each write endpoint is specific and
audit-logged; no generic "write anything" surface.

**Phase 4:** LiftTrace and CookTrace expose their own `/api/v1/` with
the same conventions, becoming peers to NutriTrace in the federation.

---

## Cross-instance references

Each instance issues its own integer ids. A CookTrace recipe that
references NutriTrace food id `42` should store both the food id and
the issuing instance URL, so the reference resolves correctly even if
the user later runs CookTrace against a different NutriTrace
instance.

Recommended reference shape (defined once here, used by all consumer
apps):

```json
{
  "instance_url": "https://nutritrace.example.com",
  "type":         "food",
  "id":           42
}
```
